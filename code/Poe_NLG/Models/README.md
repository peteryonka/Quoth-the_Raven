# Model Folder Information

---

Model data file sizes are (mostly) too big to sync with GitHub.com and so have been included in the `.gitignore` file. The model files you generate on your computer should appear in your local repo. Files generated using Amazon Web Services or Google Colab notebooks will have to be downloaded from their respective sources to save your local repo.

If you'd like to access the models generated for this project, you can visit [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VQBj9GtOc7ZeplYDYda_5GmhWJK8R9H9?usp=sharing).
