# Sequence file data

---

The cleaned sequenced files that will be created in your local directory after running the data preparation notebook are (mostly) too big to sync with GitHub.com and so have been included in the `.gitignore` file.

If you'd like to access these files without generating them yourself, you can visit [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VQBj9GtOc7ZeplYDYda_5GmhWJK8R9H9?usp=sharing).
