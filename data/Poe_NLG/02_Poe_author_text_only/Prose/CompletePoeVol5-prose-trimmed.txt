      In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their
      residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little
      sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,
      deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts
      to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a
      delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The
      Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.
      The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an
      indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all
      _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The
      Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are
      preposterous.
    
      How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of
      blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable
      thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display
      of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the
      heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily
      understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been
      brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.
    
      To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of
      costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an
      impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or
      of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that
      wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting
      a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,
      confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather
      avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry
      may at any time be successfully attempted.
    
      The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough
      diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being
      the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,
      to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,
      looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two
      entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of
      an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole
      test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once
      established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable
      to the one primitive folly.
    
      There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist
      than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to
      say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual
      defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would
      of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are
      amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of
      art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits
      of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.
    
      A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several
      pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation
      to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic
      arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly
      continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines
      occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,
      the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.
    
      Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other
      decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an
      extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,
      irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the
      proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.
    
      Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still
      very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the
      apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the
      forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary
      man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard
      discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows
      who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their
      own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have
      a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of
      small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards
      texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect
      tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching
      pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree
      Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct
      grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are
      here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of
      well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of
      Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or
      ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly
      Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen
      in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and
      radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among
      which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention
      of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and
      worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize
      fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established
      joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.
    
      _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household
      decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion
      of taste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.
      The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady
      light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or
      what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do
      wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely
      thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp
      proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass
      shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is
      a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted
      it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but principally on account
      of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on the proposition with
      which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of
      a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly
      subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of
      these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is
      sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its
      influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half
      disenchanted beneath its evil eye.
    
      In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its
      leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of
      all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes
      _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the
      embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,
      even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning
      glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle
      in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of
      all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.
    
      The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before
      observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has
      led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our
      dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine
      thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one
      who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and
      especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror
      presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing
      always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent
      in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here
      aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its
      sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four
      or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,
      a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter
      upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing
      effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,
      would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be
      altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the
      same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be
      startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.
    
      It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man
      of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The
      corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.
      As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our
      _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the
      spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in
      the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]
      means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d
      _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is
      present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose
      decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the
      weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of
      the room during his slumber.
    
      It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a
      shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of
      furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is
      at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the
      other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep
      recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a
      crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.
      They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to
      the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the
      recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a
      deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material
      of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole
      fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),
      issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles
      the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown
      open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping
      it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such
      devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the
      tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and
      determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony
      material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson
      ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that
      festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,
      _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short
      irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls
      are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small
      Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many
      paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an
      imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the
      lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or
      four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.
      The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant
      effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.
      Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the
      blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad
      but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.
      They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,
      and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to
      better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of
      the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is
      visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a
      reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary
      sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson
      silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light
      conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,
      also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed
      altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the
      sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has
      been thought sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which
      bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded
      angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with
      highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some
      light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk
      cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound
      books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand
      lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from
      He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a
      tranquil but magical radiance over all.

     Passus erat——
                    —Lucan—_De Catone_


    ——a bristly _bore_.
                    _Translation._

    
      “Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon
      the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the
      world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the
      ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,
      and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of
      the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the
      promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the
      sacrifices.”
     
    
      Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or
      sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.
    
      “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the
      heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of
      the worshippers of Baal.”
     
    
      “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the
      Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of
      Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their
      own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us
      lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver
      shekels per head!”
     
    
      “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the
      Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,
      has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,
      to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”
     
    
      “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged
      to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of
      _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a
      thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less
      gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a
      priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a
      blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of
      appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated
      elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”
    
      “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted
      Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or
      by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings
      should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not
      extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”
     
    
      That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which
      bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly
      fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty
      hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the
      solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its
      inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square
      towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and
      twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the
      wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,
      between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a
      perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the
      precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived
      on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the
      turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the
      besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an
      eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by
      several, that of the temple of Belus.
    
      “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,
      “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the
      wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”
     
    
      “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,
      not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who
      seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”
     
    
      “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman
      soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions
      of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has
      broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your
      gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought
      fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a
      true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the
      ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the
      world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every
      kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and
      see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”
     
    
      “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the
      centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against
      the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth
      the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of
      the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is
      it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or
      Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or
      Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or
      Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”
     
    
      “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too
      rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on
      the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the
      holy things of the sanctuary.”
     
    
      By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden
      basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the
      giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but
      owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of
      their operations could be obtained.
    
      Half an hour had already elapsed.
    
      “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this
      period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be
      turned out of office by the Katholim.”
     
    
      “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the
      fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our
      loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”
     
    
      “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase
      money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”
     
    
      “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they
      have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,
      Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either
      still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to
      place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while
      their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.
    


    
      “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the
      extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was
      the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.
    
      “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of
      Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”
     
    
      “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the
      bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are
      more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the
      honey of Hebron.”
     
    
      “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the
      heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our
      voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the
      psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”
     
    
      It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim
      that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.
    
      “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,
      letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the
      Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable
      flesh!”_

      During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the
      invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement
      of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around
      us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in
      the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we
      should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful
      intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a
      day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some
      acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily
      the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every
      messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.
      That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could
      neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less
      excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted
      himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at
      any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was
      sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.
    
      His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which
      I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which
      I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into
      germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my
      bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he
      was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been
      made upon my fancy.
    
      A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief
      which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to
      defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he
      maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I
      contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute
      spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of
      suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and
      was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the
      idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.
    
      The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred
      to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so
      much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for
      regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded
      and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind
      to communicate the circumstances to my friend.
    
      Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an
      open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view
      of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded
      by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My
      thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom
      and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,
      they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon
      some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its
      way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense
      forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own
      sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes
      passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor
      in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and
      calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I
      fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than
      even I did myself.
    
      Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the
      large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which
      had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far
      larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,
      because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one
      of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the
      general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of
      a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as
      the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an
      immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been
      supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this
      hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those
      of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,
      parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,
      thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in
      shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the
      rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the
      apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each
      wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above
      the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale
      apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper
      and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief
      peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s
      Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was
      as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,
      as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded
      the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,
      with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming
      evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I
      perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand
      themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so
      expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the
      monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to
      the floor.
    
      Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of
      what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of
      repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.
    
      At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we
      were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I
      occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near
      at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an
      account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed
      heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if
      my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a
      distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute
      terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but
      maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the
      course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the
      hill.
    
      I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an
      omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I
      threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my
      face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer
      apparent.
    
      My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,
      and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the
      visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed
      deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,
      with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative
      philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.
      I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the
      idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in
      the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the
      importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its
      propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence
      to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of
      Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly
      be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can
      you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought
      this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”
     
    
      He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one
      of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to
      exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine
      print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the
      book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.
    
      “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,
      I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.
      In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus
      Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class
      of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:
    
      “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic
      appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of
      the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and
      downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;
      antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The
      Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,
      at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia
      of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”
     
    
      He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself
      accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding
      “the monster.”
     
    
      “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face
      of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.
      Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for
      the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider
      has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of
      an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch
      distant from the pupil of my eye.”

      I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed
      to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to
      tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his
      seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They
      all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well
      as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there
      is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been
      quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara
      avis in terris.
    
      About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king
      troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in
      a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.
      Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”
      to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited
      his taste far better than verbal ones.
    
      At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone
      out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still
      retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were
      expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,
      in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.
    
      _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he
      _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the
      heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to
      mention himself.
    
      His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value
      was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf
      and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;
      and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days
      (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to
      laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your
      jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and
      unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our
      king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a
      triplicate treasure in one person.
    
      I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his
      sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of
      the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men
      do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional
      gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that
      afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,
      for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional
      swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a
      capital figure.
    
      But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only
      with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious
      muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way
      of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform
      many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,
      or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more
      resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.
    
      I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog
      originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no
      person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.
      Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself
      (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been
      forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,
      and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.
    
      Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close
      intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became
      sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was
      by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many
      services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although
      a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much
      influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit
      of Hop-Frog.
    
      On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined
      to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,
      occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta
      were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive
      in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and
      arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it
      seems, without his assistance.
    
      The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been
      fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could
      possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of
      expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed
      that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up
      their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,
      in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except
      in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never
      could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found
      it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all
      events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and
      Hop-Frog.
    
      When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him
      sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the
      monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not
      fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and
      madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,
      and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)
      “to be merry.”
    
      “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the
      room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here
      Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We
      want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of
      the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the
      wine will brighten your wits.”
     
    
      Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances
      from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor
      dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced
      the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he
      took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.
    
      “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly
      drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,
      your eyes are shining already!”
     
    
      Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of
      wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He
      placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the
      company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at
      the success of the king’s ‘joke.’
    
      “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.
    
      “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your
      assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of
      characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was
      seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.
    
      Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.
    
      “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”
     
    
      “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,
      abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.
    
      “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you
      mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.
      Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and
      offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.
    
      “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the
      fiends—”
     
    
      The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers
      smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,
      falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.
    
      The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her
      audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most
      becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a
      syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the
      brimming goblet in her face.
    
      The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,
      resumed her position at the foot of the table.
    
      There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling
      of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a
      low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once
      from every corner of the room.
    
      “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the
      king, turning furiously to the dwarf.
    
      The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his
      intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,
      merely ejaculated:
    
      “I—I? How could it have been me?”
     
    
      “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.
      “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his
      cage-wires.”
     
    
      “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,
      on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of
      this vagabond’s teeth.”
     
    
      Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object
      to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
      repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as
      much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another
      bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and
      with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.
    
      “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very
      tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just
      after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just
      after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd
      noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one
      of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our
      masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,
      it requires a company of eight persons and—”
     
    
      “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the
      coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!
      what is the diversion?”
     
    
      “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and
      it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”
     
    
      “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering
      his eyelids.
    
      “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it
      occasions among the women.”
     
    
      “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.
    
      “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that
      to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of
      masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will
      be as much terrified as astonished.”
     
    
      “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man
      of you.”
     
    
      “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their
      jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.
      Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by
      eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the
      company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately
      and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”
     
    
      “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was
      growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.
    
      His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but
      effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the
      epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized
      world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently
      beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to
      nature was thus thought to be secured.
    
      The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet
      shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of
      the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion
      was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by
      ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang
      was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of
      the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long
      chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,
      _and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then
      about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining
      arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each
      other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear
      natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at
      right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the
      present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in
      Borneo.
    
      The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular
      room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single
      window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially
      designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending
      by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by
      means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)
      this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.
    
      The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;
      but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer
      judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this
      occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in
      weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been
      seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account
      of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from
      out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional
      sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a
      flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the
      Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or
      sixty altogether.
    
      The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until
      midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before
      making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,
      than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the
      impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to
      stumble as they entered.
    
      The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart
      of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of
      the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of
      some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women
      swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to
      exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated
      their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the
      doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his
      entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with
      him.
    
      While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to
      his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure
      of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,
      and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very
      gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of
      the floor.
    
      Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the
      hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,
      of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus
      situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting
      them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the
      intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically
      and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the
      hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an
      instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far
      upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable
      consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and
      face to face.
    
      The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their
      alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived
      pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the
      apes.
    
      “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself
      easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.
      If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”
     
    
      Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the
      wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,
      as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a
      monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the
      chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and
      still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”
     
    
      And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with
      laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain
      flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the
      dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in
      mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the
      chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the
      eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to
      thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who
      they were.
    
      So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead
      silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such
      a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the
      king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of
      Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to
      whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the
      dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and
      glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned
      countenances of the king and his seven companions.
    
      “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see
      who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more
      closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and
      which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a
      minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the
      shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,
      and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.
    
      At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester
      to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made
      this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.
      The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:
    
      “I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.
      They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who
      does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors
      who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the
      jester—and this is my last jest.”
     
    
      Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it
      adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the
      work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a
      fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled
      his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared
      through the sky-light.
    
      It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had
      been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,
      together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was
      seen again.

Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_.
    
      It was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht
      lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some
      secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in
      their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them
      piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of
      throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer
      themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes
      up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the
      grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.
    
      Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the
      large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some
      months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with
      returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so
      precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest
      appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the
      αχλυξ η πριυ
      επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,
      surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet
      candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely
      to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many
      of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest
      in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had
      been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring
      over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the
      room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.
    
      This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had
      been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,
      the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well
      lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past
      the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been
      in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,
      therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all
      care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of
      the scene without.
    
      At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked
      at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate
      relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute
      interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,
      and expression of countenance.
    
      By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied
      business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way
      through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;
      when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of
      impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a
      numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and
      talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on
      account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their
      progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their
      gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the
      lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed
      profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There
      was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I
      have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly
      termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,
      tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of
      society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their
      own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not
      greatly excite my attention.
    
      The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable
      divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young
      gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and
      supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which
      may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these
      persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection
      of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off
      graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best
      definition of the class.
    
      The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old
      fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats
      and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white
      cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or
      gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right
      ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I
      observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,
      and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient
      pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed
      there be an affectation so honorable.
    
      There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily
      understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all
      great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much
      inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be
      mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of
      wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.
    
      The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily
      recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the
      desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,
      gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate
      clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still
      all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a
      filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two
      other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded
      lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of
      the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in
      company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat
      different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be
      defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon
      the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the
      military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and
      smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.
    
      Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and
      deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing
      from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of
      abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon
      mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the
      night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed
      a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every
      one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,
      some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a
      cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the
      glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;
      women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal
      beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in
      Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with
      filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the
      wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at
      youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,
      an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid
      ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards
      innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,
      inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole
      although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual
      lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials
      which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well
      brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy
      step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously
      wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode
      through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside
      these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,
      monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who
      sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all
      full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the
      ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.
    
      As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for
      not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its
      gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly
      portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,
      as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but
      the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the
      dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing
      a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony
      to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.
    
      The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual
      faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted
      before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each
      visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could
      frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of
      long years.
    
      With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,
      when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old
      man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which
      at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the
      absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely
      resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that
      my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,
      would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the
      fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to
      form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and
      paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,
      of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood
      thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of
      supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How
      wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then
      came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.
      Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my
      way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I
      had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little
      difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed
      him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.
    
      I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in
      stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,
      were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong
      glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of
      beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a
      closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped
      him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These
      observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the
      stranger whithersoever he should go.
    
      It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,
      soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd
      effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new
      commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the
      jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did
      not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system
      rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a
      handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held
      his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked
      close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning
      his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a
      cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so
      much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his
      demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than
      before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way
      repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at
      every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a
      narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,
      during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number
      which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a
      difference is there between a London populace and that of the most
      frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,
      brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the
      stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled
      wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who
      hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was
      surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the
      square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished
      to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting
      me as he came round with a sudden movement.
    
      In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with
      far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;
      the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a
      gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively
      deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an
      activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put
      me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and
      busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well
      acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he
      forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and
      sellers.
    
      During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,
      it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without
      attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc
      over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he
      see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke
      no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now
      utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not
      part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.
    
      A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the
      bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and
      at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into
      the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with
      incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we
      emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the
      street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same
      aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and
      there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked
      moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,
      turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great
      variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the
      principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were
      thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he
      threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his
      countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his
      breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now
      took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,
      upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his
      actions.
    
      As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness
      and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of
      some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped
      off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane
      little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in
      thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which
      brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from
      those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of
      London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable
      poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an
      accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen
      tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce
      the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones
      lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.
      Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere
      teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life
      revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned
      of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old
      man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more
      he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze
      of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge
      suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,
      Gin.
    
      It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still
      pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy
      the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original
      bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among
      the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to
      the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was
      something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the
      countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.
      Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced
      his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he
      fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to
      abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun
      arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most
      thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——
      Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely
      inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid
      the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the
      stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not
      pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the
      second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in
      front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed
      me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained
      absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,
      “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.
      _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I
      shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the
      world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and
      perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst
      sich nicht lesen._’”
    
      {*1} The “_Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_”
       of Grünninger.

      “_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las
      Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,
      importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,
      in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure
      personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We
      presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be
      a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there
      until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon
      the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,
      what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every
      fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon
      the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a
      distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that
      the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and
      drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by
      Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;
      by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.
      Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a
      hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views
      in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it
      has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound
      design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for
      example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,
      it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of
      themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,
      and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”
       or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,
      and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all
      come very straight in the end.
    
      There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by
      certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in
      more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics
      predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the
      secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them
      ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by
      way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history
      appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no
      question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals
      which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this
      arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who
      reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus
      sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.
    
      _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De
      mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead
      in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,
      therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad
      dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was
      not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his
      mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for
      duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,
      like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the
      better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be
      left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left
      unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a
      baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an
      evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks
      its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,
      and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was
      getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my
      eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he
      had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have
      mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond
      that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,
      but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made
      prophecy of his ruin.
    
      The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he
      used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six
      months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in
      the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight
      months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance
      pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,
      at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing
      moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and
      for backing his assertions by bets.
    
      Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had
      predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with
      his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to
      be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with
      a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will
      do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With
      him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on
      this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if
      not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to
      round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever
      thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty
      to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a
      vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by
      society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act
      of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.
      I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I
      entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he
      sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the
      police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil
      his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.
    
      Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of
      Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and
      this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about
      betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I
      ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a
      dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you
      what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly
      still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”
     
    
      This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it
      involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.
      Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have
      been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure
      that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in
      question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a
      man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which
      my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.
      In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to
      “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of
      devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always
      displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a
      man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something
      in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his
      offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which
      at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something
      which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to
      call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant
      pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.
      I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I
      resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve
      him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the
      toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I
      addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to
      remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at
      expostulation.
    
      When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some
      very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely
      looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to
      one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out
      the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with
      the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut
      them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became
      seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his
      nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of
      his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.
    
      I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to
      me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all
      my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still
      think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?
      Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in
      a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this
      latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself
      to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother
      knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be
      willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.
    
      Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left
      my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he
      did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For
      once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won
      for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my
      mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.
    
      But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans
      say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I
      had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,
      however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of
      this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my
      counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I
      forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up
      his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less
      reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself
      lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so
      profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.
    
      One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us
      in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross
      it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the
      archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we
      entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the
      interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the
      unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.
      He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so
      much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not
      impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well
      enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with
      decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of
      the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain
      species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,
      and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve
      him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came
      in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd
      little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the
      time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.
      At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the
      termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile
      of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as
      usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted
      upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the
      air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The
      best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and
      as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by
      Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a
      braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be
      sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his
      head that he could.
    
      I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some
      remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a
      slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I
      started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a
      nook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a
      little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more
      reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of
      black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly
      down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a
      girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and
      his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.
    
      Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk
      apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very
      odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a
      circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”
     
    
      To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,
      remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a
      Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,
      therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.
    
      “Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman
      says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;
      for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is
      particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is
      pretty sure to look like a fool.
    
      “Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,
      than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I
      suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”
     
    
      I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not
      think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our
      speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own
      eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or
      knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could
      hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those
      simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the
      gentleman says ‘ahem!’”
     
    
      “You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a
      pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you
      quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may
      as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”
     
    
      At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.
      He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a
      gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all
      the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated
      benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.
    
      “I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of
      all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of
      mere form.”
     
    
      “Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a
      pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable
      alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down
      the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a
      pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say
      after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud—“this
      is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt
      a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme
      induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable
      questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him
      my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”
     
    
      “Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and
      looking like a very old sheep in a revery.
    
      The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade
      of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”
       said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait
      here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go
      over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of
      the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and
      away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away.’” Here he took his position by
      the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up
      and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his
      apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as
      agreed upon—
    

            _One—two—three—and—away!_

    
      Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop.
      The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s—nor yet very low, like
      that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would
      clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what
      if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to make any
      other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he
      asks me to jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who the
      devil he is.” The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very
      ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all
      times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when
      I uttered the four last words of my remark.
    
      But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an
      instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had
      taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of
      the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.
      I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the
      top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing
      that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of
      a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections,
      down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the
      stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old
      gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up
      in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the
      arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had
      no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded
      that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my
      assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might
      be termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his
      head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I
      determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists. In the
      meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the
      bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. About five feet just
      above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so
      as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its
      breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to
      strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this
      brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come
      precisely in contact.
    
      He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homœopathists did not give
      him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated
      to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all
      riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister
      on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral,
      sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels
      refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for
      dog’s meat.

      I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound to
      you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected
      the Rattleborough miracle—the one, the true, the admitted, the
      undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to
      infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the
      grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.
    
      This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of
      unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas
      Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of
      the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances
      which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out
      from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the
      avowed intention of proceeding to the city of ——, about fifteen miles
      distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his
      departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the
      saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal
      was wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave
      rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was
      found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the
      whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.
    
      The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom
      friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was
      universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”
       Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the
      name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never
      yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there
      never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest,
      good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did
      you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the
      face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of
      no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” And thus all the
      hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be
      called Charles.
    
      Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough not
      longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing
      about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no
      difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable
      people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare
      word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no
      saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of
      his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence,
      that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of
      recommendation.”
    
      I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable
      and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while “Old
      Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been
      his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and,
      although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “Old Charley,” and
      never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent
      the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed;
      for “Old Charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four
      times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to
      breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine
      that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be
      a difficult thing to ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was
      Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to
      see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one
      day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat
      out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back—“I tell
      you what it is, ‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old
      fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to
      guzzle the wine at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make
      thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”—(Mr.
      Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond
      “Od rot me,” or “By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)—“Od rot me,”
       says he, “if I don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a
      double box of the best that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it,
      I will!—ye needn’t say a word now—I will, I tell ye, and
      there’s an end of it; so look out for it—it will come to hand some
      of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” I
      mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy,
      just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed
      between the two friends.
    
      Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly
      understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any
      one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he first
      heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his
      master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone
      clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing
      him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had
      been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if
      he had had a fit of the ague.
    
      At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing
      at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he
      endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a
      stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a
      week or two, or a month, or two—to see if something wouldn’t turn
      up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain
      his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often
      observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who
      are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to
      be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action,
      and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse
      their grief,” as the old ladies express it—that is to say, ruminate
      over the trouble.
    
      The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom
      and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them felt
      disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until
      something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I
      believe that, after all this would have been the general determination,
      but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a
      young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad
      character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to
      nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon
      making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.” This
      was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the
      time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” This remark of
      “Old Charley’s,” too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the
      party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr.
      Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances
      connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to
      assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered
      man.’” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various
      members of the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.
      Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no
      means a novelty, for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for
      the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.
      Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle’s friend for some alleged
      excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which
      the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old Charley” is said to have
      behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the
      blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely
      muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first
      convenient opportunity,”—a natural and very justifiable ebullition
      of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner
      given vent to than forgotten.
    
      However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at
      issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally
      through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the
      determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the
      missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the
      first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be
      made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should
      disperse—that is to say, distribute themselves in parties—for
      the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget,
      however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “Old Charley”
       finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan
      that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did—all except Mr.
      Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be
      instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “Old
      Charley” himself leading the way.
    
      As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than
      “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but,
      although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners,
      by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood,
      and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a
      week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say
      no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace,
      to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked,
      by his horse’s shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to
      the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the
      track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path
      coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of
      the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party
      came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles,
      to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track
      was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature
      had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much
      larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the
      pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and
      the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any
      result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of
      draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,
      and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and
      consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,
      supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,
      the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom
      visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered
      a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately
      recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much
      torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the
      party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner
      on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while
      there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that
      Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the
      remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he
      had seen it upon Mr. P.‘s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr.
      Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.
    
      Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was
      observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were
      excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he
      had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon,
      the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at
      once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed
      enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the
      magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant
      lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of
      Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere
      forgiveness of that wild young gentleman—“the heir of the worthy Mr.
      Shuttleworthy,”—for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had,
      no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr.
      Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of
      his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the
      suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really
      had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every
      exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his
      possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could
      conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly
      perplexing piece of business.”
     
    
      Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much
      to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted
      people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all
      sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the
      hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the
      kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his
      cause than to advance it.
    
      So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old
      Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected,
      yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of
      which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in
      the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion
      already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse
      against him the fury of the mob.
    
      One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his
      allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.
      Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They
      had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or
      two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the
      nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance
      as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were
      the Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once
      to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the
      possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And
      straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?—a
      question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible
      crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me
      to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and
      simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and
      misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,—in
      those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who
      quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her
      learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,—in
      all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of
      Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little
      Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,)
      “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose
      advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal
      phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under
      consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the
      probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the
      deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?
      very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him,
      after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had
      not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been
      altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the
      part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and
      even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the
      good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat
      to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once
      the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded,
      very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.
    
      Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd,
      after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. On
      the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the
      suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a
      little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few
      paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the
      grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of
      half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was
      noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up
      was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized
      as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved
      upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.
    
      No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon
      reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.
    
      Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being
      questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s
      disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that
      very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the
      immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had
      been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.
    
      This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked
      permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed
      his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to
      remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man
      (notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)
      had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest,
      by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the
      circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these
      circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning; he
      would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew, although his
      heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He
      then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr.
      Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had
      mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that his
      object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an
      unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank,” and
      that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to
      the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will
      originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the witness)
      now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the
      witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial
      particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr.
      Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.
    
      The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables
      to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From this
      search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound,
      russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit
      of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been
      abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the
      prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their
      concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.
      The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the
      unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials
      of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.
    
      At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had
      just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received,
      and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of
      the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of
      discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate
      beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after
      considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect
      and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial,
      was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather’s rifle,
      while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or
      its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet
      was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture,
      and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental
      ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself
      to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining
      magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately
      committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in
      the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly
      remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be
      required. This generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in
      accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct
      during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the
      present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the
      excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten,
      when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr.
      Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the
      face of the earth.
    
      The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,
      amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at
      the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence
      (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.
      Goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the
      court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the
      jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of
      “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch
      received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await
      the inexorable vengeance of the law.
    
      In the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had
      doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became ten
      times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the
      hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,
      the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled
      him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house,
      when wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little, of course, by the
      occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended
      over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.
    
      One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at
      the receipt of the following letter:
    

Charles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough
From H.F.B. & Co.
Chat. Mar. A—No. 1.—6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)

“Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.
    “Dear Sir—In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm
about two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus
Shuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your address, a
double box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet seal. Box numbered
and marked as per margin.


“We remain, sir,        
“Your most ob’nt ser’ts,    
“HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.


“City of—, June 21, 18—.
“P.S.—The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your
receipt of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.


“H., F., B., & CO.”

    
      The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.
      Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised
      Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of
      especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly
      delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large
      party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of
      broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said any
      thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the
      invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at
      all. He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that
      he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends
      to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich
      flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and
      of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often puzzled
      myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the conclusion to
      say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I
      could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he
      had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt.
    
      The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly
      respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough
      was there,—I myself among the number,—but, much to the
      vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late
      hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been
      done very ample justice by the guests. It came at length, however,—a
      monstrously big box of it there was, too—and as the whole party were
      in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be
      lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.
    
      No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had
      the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a
      few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was pretty
      much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with
      an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously
      upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during
      the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”
     
    
      After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very
      often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued.
      Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, “with
      an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few
      slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at
      the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing
      the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered
      Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and
      sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the
      countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and
      impressively, the words—“Thou art the man!” and then, falling over
      the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs
      quiveringly upon the table.
    
      The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the
      doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the
      room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,
      shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If
      I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony
      which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with
      triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of
      marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be
      turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,
      murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out
      into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his
      chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and
      in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed
      confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then
      imprisoned and doomed to die.
    
      What he recounted was in substance this:—He followed his victim to
      the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched
      its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and,
      supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by
      the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and
      thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through
      the woods.
    
      The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by
      himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.
      Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained
      handkerchief and shirt.
    
      Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty
      wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted, he
      arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell—_dead_.
    
    
      The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although
      efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had
      disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present when
      Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then
      arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat
      of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared
      to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from
      that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw
      at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or
      indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the
      true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in
      the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers
      had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and
      another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after
      having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by
      the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the
      idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be
      capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and
      also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr.
      Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong
      because I kept it altogether to myself.
    
      In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of
      Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as
      divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his
      party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry
      well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the
      bottom, I discovered what I sought.
    
      Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two
      cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the
      promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a
      stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and
      deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body
      up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press
      forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I
      anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top
      would fly off and the body up.
    
      Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as
      already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants
      with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to
      wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal
      from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I
      confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I
      counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.
    
      I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was
      released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by
      the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever
      afterward a new life.

      It’s on my visiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s all o’ pink
      satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin’
      words, “Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell
      Square, Parrish o’ Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin’ to diskiver who is
      the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun in the houl
      city o’ Lonon—why it’s jist mesilf. And fait that same is no wonder
      at all at all (so be plased to stop curlin’ your nose), for every inch o’
      the six wakes that I’ve been a gintleman, and left aff wid the
      bog-throthing to take up wid the Barronissy, it’s Pathrick that’s been
      living like a houly imperor, and gitting the iddication and the graces.
      Och! and wouldn’t it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye cud lay
      your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, when he
      is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or stipping into the Brisky for the
      drive into the Hyde Park. But it’s the illigant big figgur that I ’ave, for
      the rason o’ which all the ladies fall in love wid me. Isn’t it my own
      swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and the three inches more nor
      that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly will proportioned all over to
      match? And it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit that there is, inny
      how, of the little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way,
      and that’s a-oggling and a-goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,)
      at the purty widdy Misthress Tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (God
      bliss her!) and a most particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the
      little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a
      sling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m going to give
      you the good rason.
    
      The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first day
      that I com’d from Connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the strait
      to the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a gone case
      althegither with the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle. I percaved it,
      ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s truth. First of all
      it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two
      peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she
      clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me if it didn’t spake to
      me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass:
      “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,
      mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it’s
      mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’
      day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be
      bate in the purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart
      altegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and
      thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, “True for you,
      yer a swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be
      drownthed dead in a bog, if it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
      Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the
      twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry purraty.”
     
    
      And it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind whither
      it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the widdy by
      way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid an illigant
      card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could rade the
      copperplate printin’ on account of being lift handed) was all about
      Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and that
      the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little
      ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.
    
      And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made me
      a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing
      me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a
      great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the
      tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said “pully wou,
      woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad luck to him, that
      he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy
      Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.
    
      At the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a
      grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
      Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the
      upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and kipt
      dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what
      did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud give me
      the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.
    
      “Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,
      Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see now
      whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer
      Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid.”
     
    
      Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it was
      an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor, and
      in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil knows
      what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in
      all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the swate
      little angel, Misthress Tracle.
    
      “The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made
      sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the
      brain o’ ye.
    
      “Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner
      Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this
      gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and
      isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and
      acquaintance that I have in the houl world?”
     
    
      And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest
      curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and
      thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns
      that plumped his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon! I
      ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head on the spot, I was
      so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after awhile. “Is it there
      ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I plumped on the lift side
      of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain. Botheration! it wud ha done
      your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived her jist
      thin right in the face with both eyes.
    
      But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at
      all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. “Woully
      wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.
    
      “That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I talked
      as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was mesilf
      jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by rason of the
      illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of
      Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of
      her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took
      hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in
      natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.
    
      And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner did
      she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid
      it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as to say,
      “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,
      mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the
      squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner
      Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”
     
    
      Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for
      the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have
      died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm
      betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,
      sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the tip
      o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And wasn’t it
      mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the
      world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her
      leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest
      of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thunder, Sir
      Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s jist the mother’s
      son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the handsomest and the
      fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And
      with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the
      powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would ha split the
      seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to behould, jist then all at once, the
      consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a
      jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her
      leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it
      wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out
      of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny
      cat I shud like to be tould who it was!
    
      “Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as iver
      ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the
      likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a-goggling at her
      leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze as it
      was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir Pathrick
      now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the protectin’ o’ you, my darlint?” and
      then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the answer. “Thrue for
      you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world,
      “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman
      ye are—that’s God’s truth,” and with that she opened her two
      beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out of her hid
      althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat at Mounseer
      Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.
    
      “Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and
      then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his
      hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his
      purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git
      out o’ the spalpeen.
    
      Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,
      and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the
      widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much
      as to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I just
      ripped out wid a big oath, and says I:
    
      “Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”—and
      jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she jumped
      up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through the door, while I
      turned my head round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and
      botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I had a
      reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down the stares
      althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had hould of her
      hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says I:
    
      “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that
      ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now,
      that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But
      aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I turned round to the
      little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little
      paw that I had hould of in my own—why thin—thin it
      wasn’t—that’s all.
    
      And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,
      to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at
      all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick
      O’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he
      pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the
      likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake.
      Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I left hould
      of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship’s
      futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a nate little
      broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.
    
      “Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he—“Cot tam!”
     
    
      And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a
      sling.

                    —_French Vaudeville_

    
      That Pierre Bon-Bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications,
      no man who, during the reign of——, frequented the little Câfé
      in the cul-de-sac Le Febre at Rouen, will, I imagine, feel himself at
      liberty to dispute. That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled
      in the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially
      undeniable. His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but
      what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_—his
      thoughts _sur l’Ame_—his observations _sur l’Esprit?_ If
      his _omelettes_—if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable,
      what _littérateur_ of that day would not have given twice as much for
      an “_Idée de Bon-Bon_” as for all the trash of “_Idées_” of all
      the rest of the _savants?_ Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no
      other man had ransacked—had more than any other would have
      entertained a notion of reading—had understood more than any other
      would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while
      he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert
      “that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the Academy, nor the
      depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his doctrines were by no
      means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were
      difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account of their
      self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is
      to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that
      Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was indeed
      not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian—nor did he,
      like the modern Leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might be
      employed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or, _facili gradú_,
      the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the
      obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was
      Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned _à priori_—He
      reasoned also _à posteriori_. His ideas were innate—or
      otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in
      Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist.
    
      I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. I
      would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling
      his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of
      their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in
      which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his opinion
      the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities
      of the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the
      Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all
      events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind
      and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of
      gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the
      metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man
      has not a thousand?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they
      were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in
      other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues.
      As regards one of these foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in
      this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme _alto
      relievo_—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general
      disposition. He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.
    
     {*1} MD
    
      Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means necessary to the
      satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own
      proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any
      kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile
      was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a
      knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.
    
      At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the
      one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. At the
      epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation,
      there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,
      upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ
      widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes,
      or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature;
      stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at
      leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague
      longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil
      for wise purposes of his own.
    
      The philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy
      our serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary
      profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether
      this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such
      profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did
      not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—nor do I. Yet
      in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be
      supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive
      discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time,
      his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had
      its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du
      Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would
      sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over
      Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had
      it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the
      peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded—but this was by
      no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the
      philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange
      intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie
      of his favorite German studies.
    
      To enter the little _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was, at the period of
      our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man of
      genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have told
      you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore
      to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His large
      water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his
      master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a
      debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether
      unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect
      might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the
      metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to say,
      have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much in the
      outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of
      the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the
      little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression—which
      mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in
      creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his
      head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the
      rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering
      upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of
      his acquirements—in its immensity a fitting habitation for his
      immortal soul.
    
      I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter of
      habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I
      might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over
      his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and
      tassels—that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those
      worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—that the
      sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted—that
      the cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with
      cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more
      fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his
      slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been
      manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the
      brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—that his breeches were
      of the yellow satin-like material called aimable—that his sky-blue
      cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all
      over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a
      mist of the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the
      remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that it
      was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise,
      or rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say, expatiate upon
      all these points if I pleased,—but I forbear, merely personal
      details may be left to historical novelists,—they are beneath the
      moral dignity of matter-of-fact.
    
      I have said that “to enter the _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was to
      enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but then it was only the man
      of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the _sanctum_. A sign,
      consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of the
      volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a _paté_. On the back were
      visible in large letters _Œuvres de Bon-Bon_. Thus was delicately shadowed
      forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.
    
      Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building
      presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique
      construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the _café_. In a
      corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army of
      curtains, together with a canopy _à la Grècque_, gave it an air at once
      classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in
      direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the
      _bibliotheque_. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here
      lay an ovenful of the latest ethics—there a kettle of dudecimo
      _mélanges_. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron—a
      toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato
      reclined at his ease in the frying-pan—and contemporary manuscripts
      were filed away upon the spit.
    
      In other respects the _Café de Bon-Bon_ might be said to differ little from
      the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door.
      On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable
      array of labelled bottles.
    
      It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe
      winter of ——, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having listened to
      the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity—that
      Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked
      the door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific
      mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of
      blazing fagots.
    
      It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice
      during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre
      with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall,
      and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of
      the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and
      papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the
      tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its
      stanchions of solid oak.
    
      It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his
      chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a
      perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of
      his meditations. In attempting _des oeufs à la Princesse_, he had
      unfortunately perpetrated an _omelette à la Reine;_ the discovery of a
      principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and
      last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains
      which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a
      successful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these
      unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree
      of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well
      calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large
      black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in
      his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those
      distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the
      red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming.
      Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible
      to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and
      papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous
      manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow.
    
      He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,
      Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment.
    
      “The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the
      table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment.
    
      “Very true,” calmly replied the voice.
    
      “Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here?” vociferated
      the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at
      full length upon the bed.
    
      “I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the
      interrogatives,—“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time—that
      the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing
      importance—in short, that I can very well wait until you have
      finished your Exposition.”
     
    
      “My Exposition!—there now!—how do you know?—how came you
      to understand that I was writing an Exposition?—good God!”
     
    
      “Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly
      from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp
      that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.
    
      The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the
      stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly
      lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,
      by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,
      but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These
      garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their
      present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches.
      In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to
      the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head
      was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from
      which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles,
      with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and
      at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color
      or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a
      shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme
      precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by
      side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an
      ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and
      demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over
      his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an
      instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of
      his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps
      of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly
      from the person as to discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white
      letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine—even
      cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the
      ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an
      expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of
      the hands, as he stepped toward our hero—a deep sigh—and
      altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be
      unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the
      countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory
      survey of his visitor’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and
      conducted him to a seat.
    
      There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous
      transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which
      might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre
      Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was
      of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of
      exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men
      and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real
      character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To
      say no more, the conformation of his visitor’s feet was sufficiently
      remarkable—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall
      hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his
      breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.
      Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself
      thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all
      times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much
      of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in
      regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all
      conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading
      his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas,
      which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,
      enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas
      which, I should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known
      proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to
      afford.
    
      Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down,
      while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and
      place upon the now re-established table some bottles of _Mousseux_. Having
      quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair _vis-à-vis_ to his
      companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. But
      plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of
      their application—and the _restaurateur_ found himself _nonplussed_ by
      the very first words of his visitor’s speech.
    
      “I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi!
      hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and the devil, dropping
      at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth
      from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,
      and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and
      uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,
      joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent,
      stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment.
    
      Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh
      like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the
      cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white
      letters which formed the words “_Rituel Catholique_” on the book in his
      guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and
      in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words _Régitre des
      Condamnes_ blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,
      when Bon-Bon replied to his visitor’s remark, imparted to his manner an
      air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been
      observed.
    
      “Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak
      sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the
      d——dest—that is to say, I think—I imagine—I
      _have_ some faint—some _very_ faint idea—of the
      remarkable honor—”
     
    
      “Oh!—ah!—yes!—very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say
      no more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green
      spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat,
      and deposited them in his pocket.
    
      If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement
      was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to
      view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain
      the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had
      anticipated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet
      hazel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor
      white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above, or
      in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre
      Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but
      could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous
      period—for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am
      constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh.
    
      It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some
      inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his
      Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory.
    
      “Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon—eyes! did you say?—oh!—ah!—I
      perceive! The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given
      you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!—true. Eyes, Pierre
      Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is
      the head?—right—the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these
      optics are indispensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is
      more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner—a
      pretty cat—look at her—observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you
      behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I say,—the ideas—the
      reflections—which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it
      is, now—you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her tail
      and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most
      distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of
      metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my
      profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable
      at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I
      allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use
      them well;—my vision is the soul.”
     
    
      Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring
      out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and
      make himself perfectly at home.
    
      “A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our
      friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after
      a thorough compliance with his visitor’s injunction. “A clever book that
      of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your arrangement
      of the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many of your
      notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most
      intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper,
      as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth
      in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out of pure
      compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you very well
      know to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”
     
    
      “Cannot say that I—”
     
    
      “Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men
      expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”
     
    
      “Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the
      metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux,
      and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visitor.
    
      “There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly
      declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied—“there
      was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a
      friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons.
      He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was
      distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that δ
      υοῦς εστιν
      αυλος. He said that he would do so, and went
      home, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me
      for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to
      Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing
      the ‘αυλος.’
     
    
      “Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So
      the sentence now read ‘δ
      υοῦς εστιν
      αυγος’, and is, you perceive, the
      fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”
     
    
      “Were you ever at Rome?” asked the _restaurateur_, as he finished his second
      bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of
      Chambertin.
    
      “But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,
      as if reciting some passage from a book—“there was a time when
      occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of
      all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people,
      and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power—at
      that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only I was in Rome, and I
      have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.”
       (*2)
    
     {*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (_Cicero, Lucretius,
     Seneca_) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.—_Condorcet_.
    
      “What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup!—Epicurus?”
     
    
      “What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot
      surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of Epicurus!
      Do you mean me, sir?—I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher who
      wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes
      Laertes.”
     
    
      “That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little
      into his head.
    
      “Very well!—very well, sir!—very well, indeed, sir!” said his
      Majesty, apparently much flattered.
    
      “That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a—hiccup!—a
      lie!”
     
    
      “Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and
      Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to
      conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.
    
      “As I was saying,” resumed the visitor—“as I was observing a little
      while ago, there are some very _outré_ notions in that book of yours
      Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about
      the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”
     
    
      “The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to
      his MS., “is undoubtedly—”
     
    
      “No, sir!”
     
    
      “Indubitably—”
     
    
      “No, sir!”
     
    
      “Indisputably—”
     
    
      “No, sir!”
     
    
      “Evidently—”
     
    
      “No, sir!”
     
    
      “Incontrovertibly—”
     
    
      “No, sir!”
     
    
      “Hiccup!—”
     
    
      “No, sir!”
     
    
      “And beyond all question, a—”
     
    
      “No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking
      daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle
      of Chambertin.)
    
      “Then—hic-cup!—pray, sir—what—what is it?”
     
    
      “That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,
      musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say, I have known some very bad
      souls, and some too—pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips,
      and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,
      was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.
    
      He continued.
    
      “There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristophanes—racy:
      Plato—exquisite—not _your_ Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your
      Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus—faugh! Then let me
      see! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then
      there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,—dear
      Quinty! as I called him when he sung a _seculare_ for my amusement, while I
      toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want _flavor_, these
      Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will _keep_,
      which cannot be said of a Quirite. Let us taste your Sauterne.”
     
    
      Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to the _nil admirari_ and endeavored
      to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a
      strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although
      extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—simply
      kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The visitor continued:
    
      “I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;—you know I am
      fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to
      my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of
      Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus
      Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”
     
    
      “Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:
    
      “But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a penchant, it
      is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev—I
      mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. Long
      ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a
      little rancid on account of the gall!”
     
    
      “Shelled!”
     
    
      “I mean taken out of the carcass.”
     
    
      “What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician?”
     
    
      “Don’t mention them!—ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched
      violently.) “I never tasted but one—that rascal Hippocrates!—smelt
      of asafoetida—ugh! ugh! ugh!—caught a wretched cold washing
      him in the Styx—and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”
     
    
      “The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the—hic-cup!—abortion
      of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher dropped a tear.
    
      “After all,” continued the visitor, “after all, if a dev—if a
      gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and
      with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”
     
    
      “How so?”
     
    
      “Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know
      that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep
      a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless
      pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will—smell—you
      understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls
      are consigned to us in the usual way.”
     
    
      “Hiccup!—hiccup!—good God! how do you manage?”
     
    
      Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the
      devil half started from his seat;—however, with a slight sigh, he
      recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I tell
      you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”
     
    
      The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough
      comprehension and acquiescence, and the visitor continued.
    
      “Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some put
      up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in
      which case I find they keep very well.”
     
    
      “But the body!—hiccup!—the body!”
     
    
      “The body, the body—well, what of the body?—oh! ah! I
      perceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I
      have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties
      never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and
      Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a
      thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the
      latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why
      isn’t there A——, now, who you know as well as I? Is
      _he_ not in possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who
      writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily? Who—but stay! I
      have his agreement in my pocket-book.”
     
    
      Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number
      of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters
      _Machi—Maza—Robesp_—with the words _Caligula, George,
      Elizabeth_. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it
      read aloud the following words:
    
      “In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to
      specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I being
      aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this
      agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my
      soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did
      not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)
    
      {*4} Quere-Arouet?
    
      “A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon, he
      was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a shadow;
      Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed
      shadow!”
     
    
      “_Only_ think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow!” exclaimed our
      hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of
      his Majesty’s discourse.
    
      “Only think of a hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now, damme!—hiccup!—humph!
      If _I_ would have been such a—hiccup!—nincompoop! _My_ soul, Mr.—humph!”
     
    
      “_Your_ soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”
     
    
      “Yes, sir—hiccup!—_my_ soul is—”
     
    
      “What, sir?”
     
    
      “_No_ shadow, damme!”
     
    
      “Did you mean to say—”
     
    
      “Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”
     
    
      “Did you not intend to assert—”
     
    
      “My soul is—hiccup!—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!—a—”
     
    
      “What, sir?”
     
    
      “Stew.”
     
    
      “Ha!”
     
    
      “Soufflee.”
     
    
      “Eh!”
     
    
      “Fricassee.”
     
    
      “Indeed!”
     
    
      “Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you
      have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his
      Majesty upon the back.
    
      “Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time
      rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.
    
      “Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.
    
      “Hiccup!—e-h?” said the philosopher.
    
      “Have no funds on hand.”
     
    
      “What?”
     
    
      “Besides, very unhandsome in me—”
     
    
      “Sir!”
     
    
      “To take advantage of—”
     
    
      “Hiccup!”
     
    
      “Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”
     
    
      Here the visitor bowed and withdrew—in what manner could not
      precisely be ascertained—but in a well-concerted effort to discharge
      a bottle at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended
      from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the
      lamp.

      The _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much
      for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.
      Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it
      occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful
      of supper and go immediately to bed.
    
      A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than
      a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there
      can be no material objection to two. And really between two and three,
      there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps, upon
      four. My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded
      two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to
      admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,
      without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.
    
      Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the
      serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon
      the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a
      profound slumber forthwith.
    
      But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have completed
      my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell,
      and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.
      In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife
      thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran
      thus:
    

“Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive
this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I
have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination
of the Mummy—you know the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it
and open it, if desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of
course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven
to-night.

           “Yours, ever,
                   PONNONNER.

    
      By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide
      awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing
      all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set
      off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.
    
      There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me
      with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and
      the moment I entered its examination was commenced.
    
      It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur
      Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in
      the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.
      The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban
      sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous
      illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from
      which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such
      illustrations—the walls being completely covered with fresco
      paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich
      patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.
    
      The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same
      condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it—that is to say,
      the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,
      subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the
      complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely
      the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once
      that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.
    
      Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet
      long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was
      oblong—not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to be
      the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we
      found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_,
      composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings,
      representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed
      among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of
      hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the
      departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no
      difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and
      represented the word _Allamistakeo_.
    
      We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but
      having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,
      coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,
      but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between
      the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the
      colors of the interior box.
    
      Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a
      third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no
      particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still
      emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between the
      second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting
      accurately within the other.
    
      Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We
      had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or
      bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,
      made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and
      painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various
      supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities,
      with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as
      portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head to foot was a
      columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving
      again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.
    
      Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads,
      diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the
      scarabaeus, etc., with the winged globe. Around the small of the waist
      was a similar collar or belt.
    
      Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,
      with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,
      smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes
      (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very
      beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too
      determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.
    
      Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the
      embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the
      surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the
      powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums
      became apparent.
    
      We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which
      the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.
      No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened
      mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it was customary to withdraw
      through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body
      was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,
      when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.
    
      As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing
      his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two
      o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until
      the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some
      one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.
    
      The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old
      at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original,
      and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths
      in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither
      the Egyptian.
    
      It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some
      portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than
      other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course,
      gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with
      the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a
      hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night,
      when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there
      immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed
      to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and
      which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far
      covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the _tunica albuginea_
      remained visible.
    
      With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately
      obvious to all.
    
      I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,
      in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for
      the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of
      the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright
      fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr.
      Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk
      Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his
      way, upon all fours, under the table.
    
      After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter
      of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now
      directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over
      the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and thus
      got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we now
      applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of
      exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to
      bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the
      limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,
      which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a
      catapult, through a window into the street below.
    
      We rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the
      victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in
      an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more
      than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with
      vigor and with zeal.
    
      It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound
      incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself,
      laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the
      wire.
    
      Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the
      effect electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked
      very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in
      the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the
      fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth,
      turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very
      capital Egyptian, thus:
    
      “I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at
      your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He
      is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But
      you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided
      in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manor born—you, I say
      who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I
      think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been
      led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did
      anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your
      standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to
      suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins,
      and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to
      the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little
      villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”
     
    
      It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech
      under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into
      violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three
      things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of
      conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am at
      a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the
      other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the
      age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now
      usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and
      impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly
      natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.
      However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party
      betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any
      thing had gone very especially wrong.
    
      For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,
      out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands
      into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively
      red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar
      of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb
      into the left corner of his mouth.
    
      The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and
      at length, with a sneer, said:
    
      “Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or
      not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”
     
    
      Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of
      the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his
      left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.
    
      Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly
      to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what
      we all meant.
    
      Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the
      deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would
      afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his
      very excellent speech.
    
      I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent
      conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive
      Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other
      untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of
      Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke
      the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I
      could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of
      images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)
      the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of
      sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr.
      Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian
      comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a
      bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,
      standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown
      forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the
      mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.
      Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at
      Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and
      consented to take off his own.
    
      It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly
      upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and
      disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any
      disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the
      individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for
      it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were
      now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation
      intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.
    
      In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that
      Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did
      not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the
      apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the
      company all round.
    
      When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in
      repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We
      sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square
      inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.
    
      It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of
      Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.
      The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a
      black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid
      pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade,
      a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,
      patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of
      whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between
      the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was
      some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of
      the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be
      dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a
      comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the
      spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.
    
      The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,
      expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s
      still remaining alive.
    
      “I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time
      you were dead.”
     
    
      “Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than
      seven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means
      in his dotage when he died.”
     
    
      Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of
      which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly
      misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since
      he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.
    
      “But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age at
      the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are
      still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during
      which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”
     
    
      “In what?” said the Count.
    
      “In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.
    
      “Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to
      answer, no doubt—but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else
      than the Bichloride of Mercury.”
     
    
      “But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor
      Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt
      five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so
      delightfully well.”
     
    
      “Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than
      probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the
      infancy of Galvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common
      thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,
      and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should
      be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of
      the chief principle of the embalming process?”
     
    
      “Why, not altogether.”
     
    
      “Ah, I perceive—a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot
      enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm
      (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal
      functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in its widest
      sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.
      I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in
      the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the
      animal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever
      condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that
      condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of
      the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.”
     
    
      “The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.
    
      “Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very
      distinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the
      Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is
      the insignium. I speak figuratively.”
     
    
      “But what has this to do with you being alive?”
     
    
      “Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before
      embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did
      not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I
      should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is
      inconvenient to live.”
     
    
      “I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire
      mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”
     
    
      “Beyond doubt.”
     
    
      “I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one
      of the Egyptian gods.”
     
    
      “One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its
      feet.
    
      “Gods!” repeated the traveller.
    
      “Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said
      the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the earth has
      ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were
      with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or
      media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be
      more directly approached.”
     
    
      There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor
      Ponnonner.
    
      “It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that
      among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the
      Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”
     
    
      “There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei
      embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those
      purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and
      still remain in the tomb.”
     
    
      “Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by ‘purposely
      so embalmed’?”
     
    
      “With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely
      through his eye-glass—for it was the first time I had ventured to
      address him a direct question.
    
      “With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my
      time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most
      extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer
      than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.
      After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already
      described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable
      curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of
      science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In the
      case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this
      kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age
      of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself
      carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that
      they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say
      five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the expiration of this
      time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of
      hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena
      for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole
      herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc., which passed under
      the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have
      enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go
      about with a lantern to discover his own book. When discovered, it was
      never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it
      was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work
      immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience,
      the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally
      lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,
      pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of
      preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”
     
    
      “I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand
      gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir, but may
      I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”
     
    
      “By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.
    
      “I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned
      the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own
      epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were
      usually found to be right?”
     
    
      “The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to
      be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written
      histories themselves;—that is to say, not one individual iota of
      either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and
      radically wrong.”
     
    
      “But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five
      thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted
      that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were
      sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the
      Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten
      centuries before.”
     
    
      “Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.
    
      The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional
      explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The
      latter at length said, hesitatingly:
    
      “The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During
      my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the
      universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at
      all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by
      a man of many speculations, concerning the origin _of the human race;_
      and by this individual, the very word _Adam_ (or Red Earth), which
      you make use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a generical
      sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just
      as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the
      spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously
      upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.”
     
    
      Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of
      us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham,
      first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of
      Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:
    
      “The long duration of human life in your time, together with the
      occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments,
      must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and
      conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are to
      attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars
      of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the
      Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”
     
    
      “I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am
      somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science
      do you allude?”
     
    
      Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the
      assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.
    
      Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes,
      which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had
      flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly
      forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible
      tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban
      savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.
    
      I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He
      smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.
    
      This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to
      his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as
      yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this
      head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one
      Plutarch de facie lunae.
    
      I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in
      general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my
      queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,
      and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As for
      the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns
      possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the
      style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this
      question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very
      extraordinary way.
    
      “Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of
      both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.
    
      “Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New
      York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the
      Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went
      on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he
      referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less
      than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.
    
      The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that
      moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of
      the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but
      the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in
      a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He recollected, however,
      (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a
      kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four
      columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.
      The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two
      miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty,
      and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well as he could
      remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been
      altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over,
      within and without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to assert
      that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built
      within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred
      of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at
      Carnac was an insignificant little building after all. He (the Count),
      however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity,
      magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as
      described by the Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever
      been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.
    
      I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.
    
      “Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather
      ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of
      course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which
      the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and
      fifty feet in altitude.
    
      I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.
    
      He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should
      have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the
      little palace at Carnac.
    
      This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of
      Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon
      winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently
      discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.
    
      I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked
      me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the
      obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.
    
      This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the
      attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and
      read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear,
      but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.
    
      The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in
      his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it
      never progressed.
    
      We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at
      much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we
      enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.
    
      He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.
      When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred
      something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined
      all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of
      mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious
      constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed
      remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing
      ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some
      fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism
      that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.
    
      I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.
    
      As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.
    
      Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the
      Egyptian ignorance of steam.
    
      The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The
      silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his
      elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and
      demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern
      steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de
      Caus.
    
      We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck
      would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,
      and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the
      moderns in the all-important particular of dress.
    
      The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and
      then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to
      his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended
      itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said
      any thing in the way of reply.
    
      Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy
      with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a
      gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the
      manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.
    
      We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain. It was
      not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was
      triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.
      Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s
      mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.
    
      Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to
      bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these
      memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I shall
      behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily sick of
      this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced that
      every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be
      President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of
      coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a
      couple of hundred years.
